# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Payway Payments package!

We welcome all contributions and accept them via pull requests on GitHub.

## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept
  up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs
  is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make
  multiple intermediate commits while developing,
  please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  before submitting.
- **Pull request should be based on the `master` branch** - If you need to submit a pull request with a dependency on
  another open pull request, please base your pull request on that other pull request. Otherwise, base your pull request
  on the `master` branch.
- **Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors** - See
  the [Laravel Contribution Guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/contributions#coding-style) for more information.
- **Follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)**
